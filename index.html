    <h1>Meet Dom, the PorkPy Developer</h1>

    <p>Hey there! I'm Dom, but in the digital realm, I go by PorkPy. Why, you ask? Well, it's a quirky blend of my two great loves: savoring delicious pork pies and diving deep into Python code. Welcome to my little corner of the web, where I showcase my adventures in AI and Machine Learning.</p>

    <p>My journey through the world of tech and engineering has been anything but ordinary. Picture this: a young apprentice, hands covered in grease, learning the ins and outs of Land Rovers and Fords. That's where my story begins. Little did I know, those early days of tinkering with engines would set the stage for a career that would take me from the depths of nuclear submarines to the cutting edge of AI.</p>

    <p>After mastering the art of fixing things with whatever I had on hand as a forklift engineer (trust me, you get creative when you're out in the field!), I found myself drawn to the world of academia and research. Loughborough University became my second home, where I juggled roles as a Research Technician by day and a budding Electrical and Electronics Engineering student by night.</p>

    <p>Imagine the thrill of developing test cells for vehicle engines, the satisfaction of bringing complex systems to life, and the pure adrenaline rush of testing vehicles at the Mira Proving Ground. There's something magical about pushing a car to 140mph on a high-speed track or navigating a challenging 4x4 course. These experiences weren't just work; they were adventures that fueled my passion for engineering and innovation.</p>

    <p>As fate would have it, my journey took an unexpected turn towards the realm of robotics and machine learning. Picture a robot arm gracefully manipulating hoses and cables, guided by an LSTM model I developed. It was like teaching a machine to have the finesse of a human hand – a challenge that earned me a Masters Degree and nearly a PhD (thanks a lot, COVID!).</p>

    <p>Today, you'll find me crunching numbers and unraveling complex data patterns as a Data Scientist for a UK government department. It's a far cry from my days as a vehicle technician, but in many ways, I'm still doing what I've always done – solving puzzles, building solutions, and constantly learning.</p>

    <p>From nuclear submarines with Rolls Royce to the intricate dance of data in government projects, my career has been a thrilling ride. Each role, each project, has added a new layer to my understanding of technology and its potential to change our world.</p>

    <p>So, whether you're here to explore my latest AI projects, geek out over machine learning algorithms, or just curious about the guy who calls himself PorkPy, I'm glad you've stopped by. Grab a virtual pork pie, fire up your favorite Python IDE, and let's dive into some exciting projects together!</p>
